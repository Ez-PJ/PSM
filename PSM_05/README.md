# Trajectory

Plot the trajectory of the moon relative to the sun by solving the equations describing the movement of Earth around the sun and the moon relative to the Earth.
For the purposes of the solution, we assume that the Earth is moving in a circular orbit, the Moon is moving in a circular orbit relative to Earth.

𝐺 = 6,6743 ∙ 10−11 [𝑁𝑚2/𝑘𝑔2] - gravitational constant
𝑀𝑠 = 1,989 ∙ 1030𝑘𝑔 – mass of the Sun
𝑀𝑧 = 5,972 ∙ 1024𝑘𝑔 – mass of the Earth
𝑀𝑘 = 7,347 ∙ 1022 – mass of the Moon
𝑅𝑍𝑆 = 1,5 ∙ 108𝑘𝑚 –Earth Sun distance
𝑅𝑍𝐾 = 384400 𝑘𝑚 –Earth Moon distance
