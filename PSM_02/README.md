# Projectile Motion

Projectile motion is a form of motion in which an object or particle (called a projectile) is thrown near
the earth's surface, and it moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only. The only force
of significance that acts on the object is gravity, which acts downward to cause a downward
acceleration. There are no horizontal forces needed to maintain the horizontal motion - consistent
with the concept of inertia.

Motion equations:
$$ds/dt = v$$
$$dv/dt = a$$

Gravitation and resistance forces:
$$Fg = mg$$
$$Fg = -kV$$

where $$k$$ is drag coefficient (k=0 means vacuum, k>0 some environment with resistance)

Total force:
$$Ft = Fg + Fr$$
$$Ft = mg - kV$$

Acceleration:
$$a = \frac{Ft}{m}$$
$$a= \frac{mg - kV}{m}$$
