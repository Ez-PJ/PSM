# Pendulum

Prepare a mathematical pendulum motion simulation by solving the following equations describing the pendulum motion.

$$\frac{da}{dt}=w$$

$$\frac{dw}{dt}=e$$

$$e = \frac{a}{r}$$

$$a=gsin(a)$$

$$e=\frac{g}{r}sin(a)$$

Solve equations using the improved Euler method and RK4 method. Prepare energy graphs for potential, kinetic and total energy. Compare the results.
